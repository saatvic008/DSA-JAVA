# DSA-Java

Comprehensive Data Structures & Algorithms implementation in Java, following a structured learning roadmap based on Kunal Kushwaha's DSA playlist.

Each topic includes clean implementations, problem-solving practice, and time/space complexity analysis.

## 📌 Overview

This repository documents my complete DSA journey in Java.  
All topics are organized sequentially as covered in the playlist, ensuring strong conceptual foundations and practical implementation skills.

Every solution includes:
- Problem link (if applicable)
- Approach explanation
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity
- Clean Java implementation
